# Frequently Asked Questions

!!! question "What language is a course / training given in and by whom?"

	Courses are given in English by me [Dimitar Dimitrov](https://drdv.net/), I have
	been a lecturer (in robotics, control theory and mathematical optimization) at 
	Örebro University in Sweden as well as a researcher at INRIA here in Grenoble. I 
	have worked as a Machine Learning expert in various applications and I am passionate 
	about developing an environment and community where we grow together.

!!! question "Why on-site (can't we do it online)?"

	When you learn a craft from a craftsman, you have to interact &mdash; share ideas, 
	fail together. Direct communication is indispensable. Of course, we have various 
	channels of communication, and sometimes working remotely is fine (but to benefit 
	fully, you should consider attending on-site where spontaneous conversations and 
	shared problem-solving naturally happen).

!!! question "What do I get out of it?"

	You go through a process, which would hopefully lead to a positive change (new 
	tools, new perspective, new people around you). We do not offer a degree or 
	certification. 

!!! question "Can I contact you and schedule a course/seminar on specific dates?"

	Yes. 

!!! question "What is your refund/cancellation policy?"

	You may cancel at any time before a course starts and receive a full refund. 
	If, for any reason, you are not satisfied with a class, or cannot complete 
	it due to factors beyond your control, please ask for a refund.

!!! question "Do you provide corporate training?"

	Yes, on demand. Corporate training is provided on-site at your company’s location.
	Note, however, that the courses announced on this page are not a form of corporate 
	training.
