# Welcome to Manabiya

We provide in-person courses in software engineering, mathematical optimization and
their applications. Learning takes place through interaction with others, in a
collaborative, on-site setting. Each course has three main aims:

+ [x] **Master a practical tool**: acquire hands-on skills you can apply immediately;
+ [x] **See the bigger picture**: understand how this tool integrates into real-world
      projects;
+ [x] **Enrich your abstraction**: use the tool to model problems from various
      applications.

We are located in Grenoble, France. Come visit our [community workshops](workshops.md),
interact with us, experience our environment, and get a sense of how we work.

<h3>What to expect:</h3>

Our courses are designed to help you help yourself. We prioritize communication and
"doing together" as opposed to lecturing. Come with an idea and we'll try to build a
project together!

+ [x] If you are a University student, you can participate in projects that deepen your
      understanding in subjects you already study or are interested in learning about.
      This will help you build confidence and clarity;
+ [x] If you are in industry, you can acquire new tools and see alternative ways for
      professional development;
+ [x] If you are about to graduate high school (16-18 years old) you can get a new
      perspective, see real-world applications of what you study at school and
      understand **why** it matters (a game-changer for many).
