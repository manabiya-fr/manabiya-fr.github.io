	Python is a versatile, general-purpose programming language that enables both
    creative exploration and professional development. Through guided, real-world
    projects, you’ll build practical skills, learn how to think through problems step by
    step, and gain the confidence to experiment with your own ideas. We will build a
    complete data-processing application, with a focus on practical tools and workflows
    commonly used in data science.

-   :fontawesome-brands-git-alt: __[Git for non-coders]__  
    :fontawesome-solid-calendar-check: April 6 &mdash; 12, 2026

	This is a week-long, hands-on introduction to Git, that is specifically designed for
	non-programmers. Git is a powerful tool that has transformed the way people manage
	projects and collaborate &mdash; not just in software development, but in many
	fields. You’ll learn how to organize your work, track changes with confidence, and
	collaborate effectively.
