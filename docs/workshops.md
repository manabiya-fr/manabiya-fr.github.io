# Events & Workshops

We regularly host open [community
meetups](https://www.meetup.com/grenoble-coding-workshop) at our office. The events are
informal and practical, sometimes a bit messy. You can simply show-up and join a project
(no prior experience is required). Currently we have the following workshops (please
consult our event's
[calendar](https://www.meetup.com/grenoble-coding-workshop/events/calendar/)).

## Writing a robot simulator in python from scratch

This is a year-long project. We discuss the design of our custom
[simulator](https://github.com/manabiya-fr/mrs) and work together on the implementation
of its components. You can join at any time and contribute / learn.

## Study the Wizard book together 

The [SICP](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf) book teaches the fundamental
principles of programming and computational thinking. It helps us develop deep
understanding of how programs work beyond just writing code. This is a study group where
we gather (mostly once a week) and discuss any questions we have related to the book and
its exercises. There is no predefined schedule for which exercises to work on &mdash;
everyone progresses at their own pace and can use whichever programming language they
prefer.

## Emacs monthly meeting

The title says it all. This is a monthly get-together to discuss
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) (a cool editor and programming
environment), share ideas, and learn something new.

## Homage to Carl Sagan

Watch Carl Sagan’s Cosmos: A Personal Voyage! There’s so much wonder, mystery, and
inspiration in this series, and it’s even more exciting when we explore it together. No
prior knowledge of astronomy or science is needed &mdash; just curiosity and a sense of
wonder (we simply watch each episode at a time and discuss).
